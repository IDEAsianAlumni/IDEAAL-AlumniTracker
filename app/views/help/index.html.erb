    <h1>Administrator Functions</h1><br>
    <p>
        All Administrator functions are accesible exclusively by the admin account. Click
        on the 'Admin' tab to access them.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Creating a Mentor-to-Mentee Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        There is a table with all current Mentor-to-Mentee mappings. To create a new one,
        click 'Generate new mapping'. Select the Mentor, their Mentee, and type the first
        year of the academic year where this relationship was active (e.g. "2022" for 
        2022-2023). Upon creating this assignment, they will be shown on the table. This
        should be repeated for one Mentor and all of their Mentees. To assign an additional
        Mentor, simply create a single additional mapping for one of the Mentees which is
        already assign to the first Mentor.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Creating Mentor/Mentee Group</h2>
    <p>
        Before doing this, you should write down of the UID for each of the Mentors/Mentees
        that will be going into this group. You can find this number at in the "User Managment"
        table (ctrl+f is your friend). Now, at the bottom of the page, there is a section
        titled "Group Mappings". To create a group to be shown on the Family Tree, click 'New
        Group'. Now you will type in the academic year where this group was active (e.g. "2022"
        for 2022-2023) and create a unique name for this group. Upon creating group, it should
        appear as a dropdown with the name name year specified. Now add members to the group by
        clicking '+' button on the right, 'New Member to Group', typing in the UID of a member,
        and selecting the group to add them to. This process should be repeated for each member
        of the group (unfortunately).
    </p><br>

    <h2>Creating a Director</h2>
    <p>
        At the Mentor-to-Mentee mappings, click 'Generate new mapping'. In both the 'Mentor' and
        'Mentee' fields. Select the name of the user you would like to make a Director. Then type
        in the first year in the current academic year (i.e. "2020" for the academic year:
        2022-2023). This member will now show up as a Director for that acaddemic year's Family
        Tree.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Transitioning to a new Academic Year</h2>
    <p>
        To transition to a new academic year (i.e. landing page will be current year), click
        on the 'Admin Page'. At the very top is a submission box. To set the current year,
        simply type in the first year in the current academic year (i.e. "2020" for the academic
        year: 2022-2023). It is <strong>very important</strong> that you type in this year
        correctly, otherwise the landing page will be blank! By clicking 'Submit', the change will
        occur. As a side note, if there is no group or director data for that year, the page will
        be blank.

    <h1>Heroku</h1><br>

    <h2>What is Heroku?</h2>
    <p>
        Heroku is a service used to host the IDEAAL Alumni Tracker application. It is the centralized
        location that brings all components required to run the application together. This is the most
        important service that keeps this application running for IDEAAL.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Accessing Heroku</h2>
    <p>
        1. Visit <a href="https://id.heroku.com/login">https://id.heroku.com/login</a><br>
        2. Sign in with credentials provided during the application transfer process<br>
        3. Click on ‘ideasianamerican-alumni’<br>
    </p><br>

    <h2>Getting the Link to the Application</h2>
    <p>
        1. Go to the app on Heroku<br>
        2. There are 2 ways to get the link:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. In Heroku itself<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Go to the ‘Settings’ tab<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Scroll to the bottom until you can see the ‘Domains’ section<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Open the Application itself and get the URL<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Click on the ‘Open App’ button (can be accessed from anywhere in the app in Heroku<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. You will be directed to the IDEAAL Alumni Tracker application on a new tab and then you can copy the URL
    </p><br>

    <h2>Application Specifics</h2>
    <p>
        Below are specifics on how the application is run and all the different topics we, as developers,
        think you should be aware of in case you want to work on the application in the future. That being
        said, everything has been set up by us before the transfer of ownership of this application and
        additional work needs to be done. If there are additional questions in the future, you can reach
        out to us for help.
    </p><br>

    <h3>Application Deployment</h3>
    <p>
        We have set up the application to automatically deploy whenever the ‘main’ branch of the repository
        has been updated (through pull requests on GitHub). However, if there is ever a need to manually
        re-deploy the application, then follow the steps below:<br><br>

        1. Click on the ‘Deploy’ tab<br>
        2. Scroll to the bottom and click on ‘Deploy Branch’<br>
        3. The application will start building and get ready for re-deployment<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. The application will start building and get ready for re-deployment<br>
        4. When the build is done and re-deployment is successful, you should see something like this:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. <i>image coming soon</i><br>
        5. If the build failed, you could go to the ‘Activity’ tab and view the logs of the build and re-deployment to see what went wrong<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. There are times when the building phase would succeed but the deployment phase would fail<br>
    </p><br>

    <h3>Adding Access</h3>
    <p>
        If you have people you want to give access to in order to further develop this project, you can give their Heroku accounts access to the ‘ideasianamercican-alumni’. This will allow them to view and make changes to this app on their Heroku account.

        1. Go to the ‘Access’ tab<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. You should see a list of names who have access to this app on Heroku. It should look similar to this image:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. image coming soon<br>
        2. Click on ‘Add collaborator’<br>
        3. Add the email address of the Heroku account you want to give access to and click the ‘Save Changes’ button.<br>
        4. This will send an email to the person you want to give access to, telling them that they have been given access to the
        application on Heroku. When they log into Heroku with their credentials, they should see the ‘ideasianamercican-alumni’ app.
