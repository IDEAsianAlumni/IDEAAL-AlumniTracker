## Introduction ## 
Our application allows members of IDEAAL to connect with each other by viewing a family tree of their mentorship group. They can view their direct mentors as well as the other mentees in ther mentorship group. Additionally they have access to a directory page from which they can obtain contact information of alumni and other members of the club. The application allows members to reach out to alumni to network and gain lucrative career opportunities.
